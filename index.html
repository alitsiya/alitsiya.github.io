                <h2>365. Photography</h2>
                <p>I started 365 project on January 1st this year. The idea is to take at least one photo every day during 365 days and post it online. It's a good exercise to improve my photographic skills and also I have a lot of fun thinking of what I should shoot next. I post pictures <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHsk6GRtA4">here, of Flickr</a>.</p>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>I wrote my first program at High School, it was written on Basic. For last year I try to code each free minute. I completed several Coursera classes, two Codeacademy tutorials and have two online web-sites which use <a href="https://damp-oasis-9090.herokuapp.com/">Jango</a> and <a href="http://ayudacityblog.appspot.com/">Google App Engine</a>. First one was created during Hello Web App workshop by Tracy Osborn. Second one is Udacity Web Development free course. </p>

                    I've beeng doing this project since May 24th, 2014. And this one is the toughest. It takes a lot of work and time to raise a kid. But the output is amaizing! I never been so happy in my entire life. </p>
